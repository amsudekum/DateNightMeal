# Date Night Dinner

## Description

We've created a quiz that will make choosing a date night meal a little bit easier! After answering a handful of questions about their ideal date night atmosphere, the user will be provided with a meal and cocktail suggestion. If the user already has an idea of what they might like to eat, they can head to the recipes or cocktail pages and search for something specific.
